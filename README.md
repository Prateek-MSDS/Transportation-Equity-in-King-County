# Transportation-Equity-in-King-County

This study seeks to understand what relationship exists between the dispersion of
people with disabilities and transit access, income level, and housing affordability in
King County. We theorize that people with disabilities are likely to be reliant on public
transportation as their primary mode of travel; which may present challenges for
transportation systems that largely serve to connect suburban consumers with central
business districts. By applying a combination of social and spatial analysis to a series of
GIS maps produced to show these variables in King County, we find that our hypothesis
is accurate. The maps produced show King County Metro primarily linking suburban
parts of King County with downtown Seattle, an absence of transit in more affordable
neighborhoods, and concentrations of people with disabilities near public transit routes.
